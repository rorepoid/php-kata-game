## PHP kata game
This personal repo is a kata to play with PHP step by step where I try to make a game in console, it also will run in web so I will try to make ports and apply tests and SOLID principles.

### commands
- 🏗 Build the app
  ```shell  
  make build  
  ```  

- ⚡ Run the app in console
  ```shell  
  make run  
  ```  

- 🧪 Run tests
  ```shell  
  make test  
  ```  

- 👀 Check PHP style code standards
  ```shell  
  make check  
  ```  

- 🤖 Apply code style standards automatically
  ```shell  
  make lint  
  ```
